#+title: Variables

In JavaScript there are a few ways to go about defining variables:

#+begin_src javascript
  const x = 1
  let y = 5

  console.log(x, y)   // 1 5 are printed
  y += 10
  console.log(x, y)   // 1 15 are printed
  y = 'sometext'
  console.log(x, y)   // 1 sometext are printed
  x = 4               // causes an error
#+end_src

const does not define a variable but a constant for which the value can no longer be changed. On the other hand, let defines a normal variable.

In the example above, we also see that the variable's data type can change during execution. At the start, y stores an integer; at the end, it stores a string.

It is also possible to define variables in JavaScript using the keyword =var=. For a long time, var was the only way to define variables. The keywords const and let were introduced in 2015 with the release of ES6. In specific situations, var works in a different way compared to variable definitions in most languages.
In short, don't use var.
